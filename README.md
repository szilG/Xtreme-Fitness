## Introduction
*Xtreme Fitness Club* they are fitness enthusiast who would love to share their love of health and fitness with others.
The website designed for business purpose offering personal trainning programs, group tranning programs, apparels and nutritional products.
What more perfect place to purchase these things than a trusted fitness center? 

This is my final project of four Milestone Projects that make up the Full-Stack Web Development Diploma Training at [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net/). The goal of this project was to build a full-stack website with the use of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, Django and a relational database; as well as the implementation of a checkout functionality, which has been achieved through the use of Stripe.

Xtreme Fitness is Python-Django web application, support by a PostgreSQL (and SQLite3) database, and deployed via the Heroku PaaS. This project uses the Stripe Checkout API (for educational purposes only: not currently taking real card payments) and is styled using the Bootstrap Grid System.

**NOTE:** If you would like to test the payment functionality of this project, NO NEED to create an account. Use the card number 4242 4242 4242 4242 with ANY address details, expiry date and CVC that you choose.

## User Stories

<img src="readme/user-stories-ms4.jpg"/>


Three main users were created:

1.	Superuser (admin) can add products, description of product, price and image.
2.	General browsing users who are potential customers who have browsed on to the website but did not register
3.	Authenticated users who are customer of the site by registering (adding their contact details and creating a user and password)

<a name="database-structure"></a>

## Database Structure 

Xtreme Fitness Club site is built on Django, and uses the SQLite3 database during all development stages. Through the deployment to Heroku, the database was changed to a PostgreSQL database as that is provided by Heroku as an add-on for production.

The Django‚Äôs default user model for authorization is also in use, which allows the project to meet one of the main requirements of separating features by anonymous users, users in session and superusers.

The structure of the apps are inspired by one of Code Institute's mini projects: _Boutique Ado_.

<a name="deployment"></a>

## Deployment

<a name="local-deployment"></a>

### Local Deployment

This project was developed using [Gitpod](https://gitpod.io) as the chosen IDE and [GitHub](https://github.com) as a remote repository. The Project's source files were regularly pushed to the [GitHub Xtreme-Fitness Repository](https://github.com/szilG/Xtreme-Fitness) via the  `main`  branch. To reproduce this project within a local deployement, use the following steps and requirements:

1. Have the following installed in your IDE of choice:
	 - Git (for version control)
	 - pip (package installer for Python; pip3 was used at the time of production: October 2020)
	 - Python3 (the programming language used to produce the backend logic of this project)
2. Create an account with  [Stripe](https://stripe.com/ie), necessary for payment features in the project.
3. Use an email provider (I used [Gmail](https://www.google.com/intl/ie/gmail/about/#) for this project) and sign in and navigate to the  [Google Account Security](https://myaccount.google.com/security)  page.
4. Create two-step authentication by creating an App password for your Django app.
5. Use the same email values to set up your email username and password in the steps below:
	- Scroll to the top of this repository and click on the "clone or download button".
	- Decide whether you want to clone the project using HTTPS or an SSH key and do the following:
    - HTTPS: click on the checklist icon to the right of the URL to copy it
    - SSH key: first click on 'Use SSH' then click on the same icon as above

6. Return to your IDE and open a new Terminal window.
7. Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory.
8. Enter the following command and press 'Enter' to create your local clone:
```
git clone https://github.com/szilG/Xtreme-Fitness.git
```
9.  Install the required dependencies with the following command:
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
10.  Create an env.py file and add the following, complete with your own values:
```
import os
os.environ['DATABASE_URL'] = '<your Heroku Postgres database url>'
os.environ['EMAIL_HOST_PASS'] = '<your value>'
os.environ['EMAIL_HOST_USER'] = '<your value>'
os.environ['SECRET_KEY'] = '<your value>'
os.environ['STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY'] = '<your value>'
os.environ['STRIPE_SECRET_KEY'] = '<your value>'
os.environ['STRIPE_WH_SECRET'] = '<your value>'
os.environ['DEVELOPMENT'] = 'True'
```
11.  Add your env.py file to .gitignore to make sure your database information is not viewable.
12. To set up the Django SQLite3 tables required for this project, use the following commands:
```
python3 manage.py makemigrations
python3 manage.py migrate
```
13.  After that, create a superuser for your project with the following command and follow the instructions in the Terminal (**note:** this will be necessary to add data to your locally deployed version):
```
python3 manage.py createsuperuser
```
14.  Your cloned version is now ready to run locally with the following command:
```
python3 manage.py runserver
```
15.  Once you run your project locally, add '/admin' to the locally deployed project's URL. 
16. Add categories and products or post and comments to the database.


<div align="right"><a href="#top">üîù</a></div>

<a name="heroku-deployment"></a>

### Heroku Deployment

To deploy this project to Heroku, use the following steps as a continuitation from local deployment outlined above:


1. Create an account and sign in to [Heroku](https://heroku.com). 
2. Inside the Heroku Dashboard, create a new app with a unique name and set the region to the closest to you, eg. 'Europe'.
3. To use the Postgres database for deployment, click 'Resources' tab and under 'Add-ons' seach for 'Heroku Postgres' Select Hobby Dev plan as a free add-on.
4. In Gitpod, freeze the requirements.txt file (the file is needed for Heroku to know which filed to install) with the following command:
```
pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt
```
5. In Gitpod in your env.py set up
``` 

os.environ['DATABASE_URL'] = '<your Heroku Postgres database url>'
```
6. As with local deployment, set up the Postgres database with the following commands:
```
python3 manage.py makemigrations
python3 manage.py migrate
```
7. Import Product Data with the following commands:
```
python3 manage.py loaddata categories
python3 manage.py loaddata products
```
8. Create new superuser via 
```

python3 manage.py createsuperuser
``` 
and add username, email and password.
This will be production database for deploying on Heroku.

9. Create a Procfile with the following content (the file is needed for Heroku to know which file is needed as entry point):
```
web: gunicorn xtreme_fitness.wsgi:application
```
10. In your terminal login to Heroku with:
```

heroku login 
```
than, Disable the static files with:
```

heroku config:set DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC=1 --app xtreme-fitness
```
11. In settings.py allowd the Host for the Heroku app.
```

ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['xtreme-fitness.herokuapp.com', 'localhost']
```
12. Add and Commit your changes and Push to the GitHub after Pusth to Heroku as well
```

git add .
git commit -m "your commit message"
git push (gitHub push)
git push heroku master
```
13. To automatic deploy click to the Deploy tab and on Deployment method section set it to connect to GitHub than search for the repo and click to connect. Make sure Enable Automatic Deploys.
14. Go to the 'Settings' tab, click on the 'Reveal Config Variables' button, and input the following values:

| **Key** | **Value** |
--- | ---
 DATABASE_URL | your Heroku Postgres database url
