## Introduction
*Xtreme Fitness Club* is a fictional website designed for business purpose offering trainning programs and products.

This is my final project of four Milestone Projects that make up the Full-Stack Web Development Diploma Training at [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net/). The goal of this project was to build a full-stack website with the use of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, Django and a relational database; as well as the implementation of a checkout functionality, which has been achieved through the use of Stripe.

Xtreme Fitness is Python-Django web application, support by a PostgreSQL (and SQLite3) database, and deployed via the Heroku PaaS. This project uses the Stripe Checkout API (for educational purposes only: not currently taking real card payments) and is styled using the Bootstrap Grid System.

**NOTE:** If you would like to test the payment functionality of this project, NO NEED to create an account. Use the card number 4242 4242 4242 4242 with ANY address details, expiry date and CVC that you choose.
